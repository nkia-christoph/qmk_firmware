This is not quite the Aus Der Neo Welt (From The Neo World) layout (http://www.adnw.de/)
but an ortho, thumb keys and hopefully programmer friendly adaptation based on the BuT variant I called
Progammer BUX. It's goal is it to alleviate and support general office and programming workloads.


Attention! This layout is NOT a direct result of the ADNW method although I'm looking into it for a future revision.
