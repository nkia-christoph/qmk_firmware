This is not quite the Aus Der Neo Welt (From The Neo World) layout (http://www.adnw.de/)
but an ortho, thumb keys and programmer friendly adaptation based on the BuT variant I called
Progammer BUX.

Attention! This layout is NOT a result of the ADNW method although I plan to look into this in the future.

The general idea is to make it as compatible as possible by providing
translation layers for the multiple german & english layouts out there
meaning that you won't have to change the layout settings in your OS.
